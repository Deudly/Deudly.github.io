## Hey, I am Deudly
I am Deudly, a developer. I think I know Javascript and NodeJS but nobody believes that. I used to code Minecraft plugins in Java but I grew up and I left the Minecraft community because I didn't enjoy playing that game anymore. Currently, the programming languages I use are Javascript with NodeJS and C#

Feel free to visit my [profile in GitHub](https://github.com/Deudly) or continue reading this website to know more about me and my projects.

## Public Personal Projects

I've published some of my own projects in Github. These are:

[Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneHosting/Glowstone): This is the best open-source project I created. It's a Minecraft server hosting panel, a website for Minecraft hosting companies.

[Flying Squid Essentials](https://github.com/Deudly/Flying-Squid-Essentials): Flying Squid is a Minecraft server written in Javascript. Currently the server is in a very early development phase and its usage is not recommended. So, Flying Squid Essentials is the Essentials plugin for this server :D

[SandboxTool](https://github.com/Deudly/SandboxTool): An app to download and update a compiled version of LeagueSandbox's GameServer. Running in NodeJS

[BaronPowerPlay](https://github.com/Deudly/BaronPowerPlay): A simple Baron Powerplay calculator website. It's hosted in Github Pages so you don't even need to download it.

## My contributions to other projects

[LeagueSandbox's LobbyServer](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/LobbyServer): I contributed a lot to this project, in fact I'm the person with more commits in this project. 

[LeagueSandbox's LobbyClient](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/LobbyClient): The client for the LobbyServer. I'm one of the persons who most contributed to this project.

[LeagueSandbox's GameServer](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer) and [LeagueSandbox's LeagueDefault](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/LeagueSandbox-Default): I coded some spells for this sandbox but my contributions to this project are little.
