# Welcome to my portfolio
I am Deudly, a studient and future software engineer based in Spain. I am experienced with Javascript and NodeJS, Java and C# and I worked in several projects, some of them open-source.

Feel free to visit my [profile in GitHub](https://github.com/Deudly) or continue reading this website to know more about me and my projects.

## My experience programming

Since the very first moment I started programming until today, I've been gaining experience, as I've been working on lots of projects with many people from all over the world. My biggest projects are private and most of them are coded using NodeJS, because of its easiness.

I've developed from web applications, such as competition-managment sites, to 2D multiplayer realtime videogames. Even some smartphone apps and computer programs. But, because of their nature, I cannot show them here. Though, if you want further information about my experience and those projects, you can contact me through my email.

### Some open-source projects I published

Unlike the other projects, these are some that I can show because they are open-source. I will feature only two but there are a couple more on my Github profile.

[Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneHosting/Glowstone): When it comes to free server hosting panels, there aren't a lot of possible choices. In addition, if you look for Minecraft specific solutions, it gets much more difficult to find one. Glowy is my own alternative for that, open-source, user friendly and easy to setup were the goals.

[Client](https://github.com/Deudly/Client) and [ClientServer](https://github.com/Deudly/ClientServer): While it is now archived, it was a really useful client and server application that worked as an interface to let users interact with the server and execute online multiplayer League of Legends games, using a public project named [League Sandbox's Gameserver](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer). The project required to work with Electron and other Javascript frameworks, as well as working with Linux to setup servers.

## Get in touch with me

I am open to any kind of offers, but I am mostly looking for projects where I can continue growing and developing my skills.
